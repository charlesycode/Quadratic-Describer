# Quadratic-Describer
A program that describes quadratic equations. Created as an assignment for my AP CS A class.
This program explores many mathematical functions and formulas that are used to create a quadratic equation.
The program explores the usage of if statements, inputs from console.
Some of this code was taken from the repository Calculate.
